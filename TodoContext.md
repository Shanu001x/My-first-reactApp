In this Project we Are going to make a todo application using react and trying to use optimise approach of context API for state management. And we Will Use Local Storage to save  the data in browser storage so that even if user refreshes or closes the tab, The data will still be there.

# Getting Started with Create React App
- npm Create Vite@latest
- Choosen  Features: React, javaScript. 
- For Styling - Installed Tailwind CSS. 
- Installation finished. Now what?

#  Project Structure - 
- Making a new folder "Context" in src folder. 
- Creating a context file in it "AddTodoContext.js". 
- Making another folder named "Components" and adding the TodoItem.jsx and Todoform.jsx component there.
- Adding a index.js file in both Context folder and components to export all the components and important hooks. So that we can import all neccessaries from one file.This approach is called "index-based exporting" or "barrel exporting." 
-  Adding AddTodoContext to index.js from Components Folder.

**javascript*
javascript is used for writing logic of our application. It can be run on any browser or environment that supports (HTML, CSS or JAVASCRIPT)
